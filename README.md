This repository contains data and scripts used to generate the figures and analysis in following manuscript

> **A distributional view on atmospheric predictability within a 1000-member general circulation model** by Man-Yau Chan, Hristo G. Chipilski, Jack Schwartz, Max Albrecht, Aiden Ridgway, and Saurav Dey Shuvo

&nbsp; &nbsp; 

## Overview

The resources provided here support reproducibility of the figures and key diagnostics presented in the manuscript. All scripts operate on precomputed `.pkl` data files, which contain processed output from the 1000-member general circulation model (GCM) ensemble simulations discussed in the paper.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 

## Contents

- `diagnostics_pkl_files/`  
  Directory containing `.pkl` files with ensemble diagnostics, statistics, and other intermediate data products used to create the figures in the manuscript.

- `scripts/`  
  Python scripts used to load the `.pkl` data and produce the figures appearing in the manuscript.

- `figures/` *(optional)*  
  Output figures generated by the scripts, if included.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 


## Requirements

The scripts assume a standard scientific Python environment. Key packages include:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pickle` (standard library)
- `datetime` (standard library)
- `copy` (standard library)
- `os` (standard library)
